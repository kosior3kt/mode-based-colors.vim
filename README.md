# mode-based-colors.vim
It's a simple plugin to neovim, that allows you to have cursor, numbers and background change color when you change mode 
#Technically it is working flawlessly 80% of the times
Also I broke sth so it's probably not even working 
Creating plugins with lua is so bloody complicated
why can't we all just use C...?

### anyways
feel free to 'get inspired'
by source sode (i suggest file lua/mode-based-colors/configuration)
